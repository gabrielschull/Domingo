Going forward, obviously styling needs to be improved, but finding more detailed place specifications could be cool. 
Wanted to make this app more weekend-focused so I want to implement a weekend planner/show places open on weekends, rather than just at the time of use. Also want to add users to favourite places, add to calendar,
and be able to plan trips in various EU countries where things are always closed on weekends.
